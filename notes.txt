magic happening
    - Arc
        - `number` and `alias` are the same object
        - kind of like Python
        - Arc vs Rc
    - thread::spawn
        - FnOnce/FnMut/Fn
            - self vs &mut self vs &self
        - 'static
            - move keyword is required
            - EXAMPLE getting rid of the Arc doesn't work
        - Send
            - Rc doesn't work
    - Deref/DerefMut
        - Deref in println and DerefMut with the += operator
            - MutexGuard docs
            - int_holder.rs
        - .lock()
            - EXAMPLE getting rid of the Mutex doesn't work
        - add_loop()
            - Contrived here, but common as &String -> &str.
alternatives
    - Mutex only, violates the 'static bound
    - EXAMPLE global Mutex, non-const function error
    - EXAMPLE unsafe global Mutex with MaybeUninit
    - EXAMPLE safe global Mutex with once_cell::sync::Lazy
    - EXAMPLE crossbeam::scope also works
        - both of those are going into std someday
    - can we get rid of the Mutex?
        - RwLock
        - atomics
