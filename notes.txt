    - The 0u64 explicit type is optional.
    - The move keyword and & operator in thread::spawn are
      mandatory.
    - Using `number` instead of `alias` fails.
        - Note the warning about "deref coercion".
    - The * operator in println is optional.
        - MutexGuard implements display.
    - However the * operator before += is mandatory.

desugared.rs
    - std::ops::Deref docs
        - compare to std::ops::Add
    - detour into int_reference.rs
    - detour into int_holder.rs
        - Note how deref() doesn't *replace* the star.
          Instead, it happens *before* the star. This is
          different from add().
        - If defer() replaced the star, it would need to
          return a value. But note how assignment couldn't
          work if deref_mut() returned a value.
